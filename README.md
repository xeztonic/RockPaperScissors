# Rock – Paper – Scissors (Console Version)

A simple **Rock–Paper–Scissors** game written in JavaScript, playable directly in the browser console.

## How It Works

- When the game starts, the user is prompted to choose between **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**.  
- The computer randomly selects its own choice.  
- The user’s input is **not case-sensitive**, and the program assumes it is valid.

Each round, the console displays:
- **Round number**
- **Computer’s choice** and **Human’s choice**
- **Result message** (e.g. “You won this round!” or “You lost this round!”)
- **Updated scores** for both players

The game continues for 5 rounds, as it is mentioned in https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors, then displays the final result.

## How to Play

1. Open the game’s HTML file in your browser.  
2. Open the **Console** (F12 → Console tab).  
3. The game will prompt you to enter your choice.  
4. Follow the messages in the console to see round results and scores.

Enjoy the battle of Rock, Paper, and Scissors! ✊📄✂️
