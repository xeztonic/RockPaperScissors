# Odin Project: Rock – Paper – Scissors (Console Version)

A simple **Rock–Paper–Scissors** game written in JavaScript, playable directly in the browser console.

## How It Works

- When the game starts, the user is prompted to choose between **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**.  
- The computer randomly selects its own choice.  
- The user’s input is **not case-sensitive**, and the program assumes it is valid.

Each round, the console displays:
- **Round number**
- **Computer’s choice** and **Human’s choice**
- **Result message** (e.g. “You won this round!” or “You lost this round!”)
- **Updated scores** for both players

The game continues for 5 rounds, as it is mentioned in https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors, then displays the final result.

## How to Play

1. Open the game’s HTML file in your browser.  
2. Open the **Console** (F12 -> Console tab).  
3. The game will prompt you to enter your choice.  
4. Follow the messages in the console to see round results and scores.
